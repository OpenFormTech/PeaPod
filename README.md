# PeaPod

A cloud-connected isolated and automated plant growth environment, able to generate any environment from a combination of independent environment parameters. 

Designed as both a hassle-free food production system and a research tool for precise and distributed mapping of the plant-environment relationship.

### Features

See our [`proposal`](/docs/design/designproposal/DesignProposal.pdf) (WIP) for details.

### Background

See our [`design brief`](/docs/design/designbrief/DesignBrief.pdf) for details.


### Innovations
PeaPod is not a fancy container with a light stand. 

PeaPod can precisely replicate climates for optimal growing conditions but also has the ability to collect data during the growing cycles. This data is then used to further optimize climate parameters so food grown in PeaPods will taste better over time.

PeaPod is modular and easy to assemble. Construction with aluminum extrusion allows PeaPods to be transported like IKEA furniture, useful for situations where a lot of food is required at the end of a long journey. Alot of PeaPods can be collapsed into a tiny space. This also means PeaPods can be configured to be any size to grow any type of plant.

PeaPod is self optimizing, versatile, easy to assemble, and it makes food.
