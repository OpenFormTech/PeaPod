# Animation Storyboard

_"You are required to submit a **5-minute** (maximum length) design animation demonstrating a **simulation** of your food production technology **under operation**. This animation should include key elements, such as: the setup, any operation from a user perspective, various inputs and outputs and the shutdown and cleaning process. It is recommended that the animation be saved on a platform that support video files (e.g., YouTube, Google Drive) and provide a link of the video in your submission."_ ([DSFC Applicant Guide](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/deep-space-food-challenge/application-guide#4.3))
