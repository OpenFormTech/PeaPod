\subsection{Housing}
\label{sec:housing}

\textbf{Purpose \& Function}: \textit{Isolates} and \textit{Insulates} growth environment from exterior environment (heat, light, humidity). Provides structural integrity and mounting points for other subsystems (\textit{Frame}).

\textbf{Method}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Insulation (\textit{keep in}):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Heat - Insulative/reflective internal shell
        \item Light - Reflective internal shell
        \item Moisture - "Sealed" shell
    \end{itemize}
    \item Isolation (\textit{keep out}):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Heat - Insulative shell
        \item Light - Opaque shell
        \item Moisture - "Sealed" shell
    \end{itemize}
    \item $\therefore$ Frame skeleton w/ solid, internally-reflective, "sealed" panels;
    \item Standard subframes for mounting entire subsystems modularly;
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Features}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aluminum extrusion skeleton w/ standard mounting channels;
    \item Foam insulation panels w/ mylar internal coating slide into exoskeleton channels;
    \item Trays - base subframe unit, adaptable; mounted to vertical internal channels for vertical repositioning; all connections are \textit{quick-disconnect} (i.e. quick-connect tubing for grow tray, push connectors for lighting):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Grow trays - Support plants (via grow cups), aeroponic nozzles (See \ref{sec:aeroponics}, and misting container.
        \item Lighting trays - Support LED boards, driver board (See \ref{sec:lighting}).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Justification}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Function}: Insulation increases thermal and light efficiency. Isolation increases safety against cross-contamination, pathogens, harmful substances.
    \item \textbf{Method}: Solid frame-and-panel construction is efficient for packing away, and is honestly just simple. Adaptable tray subframes make future feature development easier, and allows to modularly swap subsystems.
    \item \textbf{Features}: Aluminum extrusion is commonly used for frames. Allows strong, repositionable mounting via channels. Foam insulation is highly insulative and opaque, and mylar ensures internal light reflection. Sliding directly into extrusion channels boosts "seal".
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection{Aeroponics}
\label{sec:aeroponics}

\textbf{Purpose}: Delivers \textit{nutrients} and \textit{pH}-balanced, \textit{temperature}-controlled \textit{water} to the plants via a \textit{fine mist} (~50 micron mean droplet diameter).

\textbf{Function}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inputs}: Filtered/RO water under positive pressure, pH up \& down solutions, concentrated nutrient solutions, pump control (on/off relay to pump power), nozzle control (on/off relay to solenoid)
    \item \textbf{Outputs}: Mist
\end{itemize}

Utilizing a diaphram pump and pressure accumulator tank, filtered water with correct ph and nutrient concentration is pressurized to 80 psi before being atomized by the nozzle and subsequently abosorbed by the roots.

\textbf{Method}:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Water is sourced from an external RO system with positive pressure;
    \item Water is pressurized to constant 80psi;
    \item Water is heated or cooled to a given temp (\ref{sec:automation}); % TODO: Add water temp to environment control?
    \item Nutrient and pH-adjustment solutions are mixed in-line at an adjustable ratio (\ref{sec:automation}); \footnote{I.e. add X mL of nutrient solution Y per mL water to achieve Z ppm, or add A mL of pH down solution per mL water to achieve a pH of B.}
    \item Flow to nozzle is controlled (on/off) (\ref{sec:automation}
    );
    \item Nozzle turns pressurized water into mist;
\end{itemize}

    \item \textit{Accumulator Tank}: Uses an air bladder to create and stabilize pressure.
    \item \textit{Pressure Sensor} reports to computer (\ref{sec:automation}). Allows for shutoff of pump in case of emergency.
    \item \textit{Adjustable-rate Siphon Injection Manifold}: A set of venturi-based siphon injectors for flow-ratio siphoning of solutions (onen siphon per solution). See \ref{sec:manifold}.
    \item \textit{Solenoid Valve} - Enables on-demand (\ref{sec:automation}) misting.
    \item \textit{Grow Tray Quick-Disconnect}: Connectors between aeroponics supply and nozzles that allow for quick disconnection with auto-shutoff so the trays may be removed.
    \item \textit{Nozzle}: Mounted to grow tray, pointed at plant roots. 80psi water through a 0.4$\to$0.6mm orifice produces 5$\to$50 micron water droplets. %TODO: Source??
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\textbf{Justification}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: A high pressure aeroponics system eliminates water parameter feedback, and is 98\% more water efficient than traditional farming.
    \item \textbf{Function}: RO water has no dissolved nutrients and a neutral pH of 7.0. This enables easier and more reliable calculations. In addition, it has no particulate or minerals, minimizing the chances of nozzle clog.
    \item \textbf{Method}: System is medium-free, eliminating risk of pathogens developing within root zone. Using a nozzle ensures the nutrient solution is evenly distributed. 5-50 micron mean droplet size is optimal for plant growth. %TODO: Source?? also more detail here
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Solution Injection Manifold}

    \item Manifold splits off into branches (one per solution)
    \item Each solution branch:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A venturi siphon for fixed flow-ratio injection;
        \item An adjustable-flow valve controlling solution flow rate;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Manifold recombines

    \item \textbf{Function}: Air management ensures an even temperature throughout the entire growth environment. Thermal exchange effectively pumps heat into or out of the growth envrionment.
    \item \textbf{Features}: Peltier devices have better space and energy efficiency, less complexity (no liquids, pressurized fluids, etc.), and can provide precise temperature control at low voltages through automation via methods such as PID. They can also operate as both heaters and coolers, and can be easily controlled electrically.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textit{Mesh Piezo Disc}: Driven by the circuit, generates a vapour when water is passed over it.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Justification}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Function}: RO water contains no minerals/particulate, and as such prevents the common problem of piezo/mesh calcification.
    \item \textbf{Method \& Features}: The nebulizer approach is easily electrically controllable and produces a consistent fine vapour. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Air Dehumidification}

\subsection{Optimization}
\label{sec:optimization}

\textbf{Function}: Continuously improve yield/etc. of crops as more environment parameter and crop metric data is gathered.

\textbf{Method}: 

Assume a plant's growth rate (or state change) is related to its current internal state $\vec P \in \R^n$ (for $n$ plant metrics) and the environment conditions $\vec E \in \R^m$ (for $m$ environment parameters). Let these both be functions $\vec P (t),\vec E(t)$ defined at each $t$, where $t=0$ indicates the time of planting. Assume that this relationship is constant for all members of a given species.

Define plant state change $\vec P'$: 

$$\vec P'(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\vec P(t)$$

Define the plant-environment behaviour function $Q$: 

$$Q(\vec P(t), \vec E(t), t)=\vec P'(t)$$ 

Aka given the current internal and external states, determine the plant's state change.

By setting $\vec E_{set}(t)~\forall~ t$, recording $\vec P(t)~\forall~ t$ and $\vec E(t)\approx \vec E_{set}(t)~\forall~ t$ (See \ref{sec:environment}), and calculating $\vec P'(t)~\forall~ t$, we can fit $\vec Q$ to our data.

By fitting $\vec Q$, we can predict $\vec P$ at any $\vec E$ and $t$. For example:

$$\vec P(t+\Delta t)=P(t)+\Delta t\cdot Q(\vec P(t),\vec E(t))$$

\textbf{Features}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Machine learning model to represent $Q$
    \item Environment sensors to collect $\vec E$
    \item Plant metrics to collect $\vec P$
\end{itemize}
