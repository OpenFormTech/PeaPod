\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}

The purpose of this document is to outline the fuction and features of a design proposed to meet the PeaPod Requirements.

It accomplishes this by addressing the following prompts on a recursive tree basis:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{What} is the design's \uline{purpose} and \uline{function}?
    \item \textbf{How} does it accomplish this? What is the \uline{method/process}?
    \item \uline{Justification} on how the selected features meet the method better than alternatives.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\section{Design}

The purpose of the design is derived from the opportunity statement:

PeaPod is "an \uline{automated} and \uline{isolated} \uline{aeroponic} crop growth system, able to generate any \uline{growth environment} from a combination of independent \uline{environment parameters}, with both environment and crop growth \uline{data collection} for \uline{optimization}".

The primary function of the overall design are derived from both the overall purpose as well as the system inputs and outputs as defined by the DSFC Applicant Guide \cite{applicantguide}.

\subsection{Automation}
\label{sec:automation}


\textbf{Function}: Performing growth-, maintenance-, and data-related tasks autonomously on the basis of both schedule and necessity to reduce crew maintenance time. Maintains the homogeneity of the internal environment.

\textbf{Process}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User inputs program:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Action-at-timestamp, e.g. lights on at 08:00;
        \item Control target with start/end, e.g. hold air temperature at 22°C from 11:00 to 18:00;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Notification on maintenance requirement (i.e. non-automated input/output management);
    \item "Sense, Plan, Act" robotics/control model:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Senses} current conditions;
        \item \textit{Plans} a path to desired condition;
        \item \textit{Acts} to change current condition to desired condition;
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Features}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Central computer system with internal clock and cloud connection;
    \item Environment sensors (\textit{Sense});
    \item "Program" of time-series and/or control target instructions (\textit{Plan});
    \item Actuators (\textit{Act});
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Justification}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: Increased accuracy/precision over human interference, minimize human hours spent. Enables control over all parameters simultaneously.
    \item \textbf{Process}: Data structure matches $\vec E$ from the optimization routine (see Section \ref{sec:optimization}). Control loop-style topology is common is well suited for controlled-environment agriculture.
    \item \textbf{Features}: Automation implies computers. Sensors and actuators directly parallel process components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Isolation/Insulation and Housing}
\label{sec:isolationinsulation}

\textbf{What}: Isolates growth environment from exterior environment, provides structural integrity and mounting points.

\textbf{How}: Cube exoskeleton (aluminum extrusion) holds solid (acrylic/foam/corrugated board), internally-reflective (mylar) panels in place and aids in mounting plant growth platforms, lights, etc.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Isolation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Heat - Held in by mylar, blocked out by solid insulation via panels;
        \item Light - Blocked out by panels, reflected in by mylar;
        \item Moisture - Retained by caulking/other sealing around panels;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mounting:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Growth trays - Mounted to rails fastened to aluminum extrusion channels;
        \item Lights - Many boards mounted to sheet fastened to aluminum extrusion channels;
        \item Nozzles - Mounted to inside-bottom face of growth tray;
        \item Sensors - Mounted to various points (per-sensor), often fastened to aluminum extrusion channels;
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why}: Increases thermal and light efficiency. Isolation increases safety against cross-contamination, pathogens, harmful substances. Simple and strong construction with dedicated mounting channels.

\newpage

\subsection{Aeroponics}
\label{sec:aeroponics}

\textbf{What}: Medium-free growing method that uses nutrients dissolved within atomized water.

\textbf{How}: High-pressure nozzles deliver atomized nutrient solution to plant roots. Uses parallel distribution topology.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pump fills tank with water that has nutrients dissolved within;
    \item Tank uses an air bladder to hold water at desired PSI;
    \item Switch checks line pressure and activates/deactivates pump to maintain PSI;
    \item Solenoid ball valve feeds water to nozzle;
    \item Nozzle atomizes water to $\approx$50 micron droplets;
    \item T-quick connects with solenoid ball valves at every unit height feed individual trays;
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why}: No water parameter feedback, 98\% more water efficient, minimizes pathogens and waste water.

\subsection{Environment Control}
\label{sec:environment}

The environment control feature can be broken up into \textbf{control systems} (\ref{sec:airtemp}-\ref{sec:dehum}; sometimes in two parts) and \textbf{set systems} (\ref{sec:watertemp}-\ref{sec:lighting}).

\subsubsection{Air Temperature}
\label{sec:airtemp}

\textbf{What}: Maintaining desired air temperature within the enclosure.

\textbf{How}: Thermoelectric heating/cooling system (peltier tiles w/ polarity switch, 'dimming' current control, PID) on a heat sink w/ fan, feedback from distributed temp sensors.

\textbf{Why}: TECs have better space and energy efficiency, less complexity (no liquids, pressurized fluids, etc.), better control vs other methods. PID provides best control.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Air Humidification}
\label{sec:airhum}

\textbf{What}: Adding water vapour to air.

\textbf{How}: Ultrasonic nebulizer (piezo disc w/ custom driver circuit), RO water.

\textbf{Why}: Piezo for droplet size, commonly used; RO for purity of water vapour.

\subsubsection{Air Dehumidification}
\label{sec:dehum}

\textbf{What}: Absorbs water vapour from the air.

\textbf{How}: Silica gel bead cartridges with fans/valves to control airflow across.

\textbf{Why}: Non-toxic, safe, cheap, effective. Color-changing indication at saturation, easily reset by baking and recapturing water.

\subsubsection{Solution Temperature}
\label{sec:watertemp}

\textbf{What}: Maintaining desired water temperature within the water store.

\textbf{How}: Same as \ref{sec:airtemp}; on a water block.

\textbf{Why}: Same as \ref{sec:airtemp}.

\subsubsection{Solution Nutrients}
\label{sec:nutrients}

\textbf{What}: Precisely dosing the correct amount of various nutrients (K${}^+$, NO${}_3^-$, etc.) to the water system at setup/water addition.

% TODO: List of nutrients?

\textbf{How}: Syringe-like dosage via servo motor to set ppm based on fill volume.

\textbf{Why}: Syringe dosage is precise, easy to refill.

\subsubsection{Solution pH}
\label{sec:ph}

\textbf{What}: Precisely adds pH up/down solutions to set the solution pH at setup/water addition.

\textbf{How}: Same as \ref{sec:nutrients}.

\textbf{Why}: Same as \ref{sec:nutrients}.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Lighting}
\label{sec:lighting}

\textbf{What}: Wide spectrum precision LED lighting targeting PAR.

\textbf{How}: N LED series/colors, N controlled-current PWM drivers, M LEDs per series = NxM LEDs. Custom LED boards wired in series, one power board per tray, w/ diffusion.

\textbf{Why}: LED > every other type in every way, PWM easy protocol, CC because they’re LEDs.
