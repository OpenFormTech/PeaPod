> What is the value in doing mass research with PeaPod?

mass research with PeaPod = optimizing "artificial agriculture"

Artificial agriculture is going to become huge, and bulk crop demand is going to skyrocket. 

Bigger PeaPod Research -> More in-depth and broader knowledge of plant expression in artificial environments -> Optimization of artificial agriculture (energy/water cost, nutrient density, mass/yield, etc. crop value)

**A)** I generate and sell the data to "agricultural firms".
B) I am an "agricultural firm", and use the data to grow crops.
